# BDE (Browser Data Exporter)

Requires pandas so use 'pip install pandas' 

A collection of python scripts made to export the default users browsing and download data. Currently only has firefox downloads but firefox history and chrome downloads and history will be added.
The FirefoxDownloads script exports a json file with data such as URL, File name, File path, Time added, Time completed, and state

There will be more scripts added as i work on the project.

A possible application could be usng the script to save what youve downloaded without keeping the original files.
